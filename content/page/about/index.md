# About Me

Hi, I'm **Steffen Axer**, a senior transport modeller, mobility strategist, and an active developer of **MATSim** â€” a leading open-source framework for simulating transport systems.

I started my journey with MATSim in **2017**, when I began my career at **Volkswagen Group Research**. Since then, Iâ€™ve contributed to its **core development**, enhanced its **functionality**, and advocated for its **real-world application** in solving complex transportation challenges. Iâ€™m passionate about pushing the boundaries of how we understand and improve **mobility** in both urban and regional contexts.

As a mobility strategist, I specialize in **optimizing Demand Responsive Transport (DRT)** and **public transit systems**, bridging the gap between **scientific research** and **real-world practice**. My work aims to translate cutting-edge modelling techniques into actionable strategies that improve accessibility, efficiency, and sustainability in transportation.

The use cases for MATSim simulations in my work range from **physical vehicle design**, **business case optimization**, to **strategic regional analysis** â€” demonstrating the versatility of agent-based modelling in addressing diverse mobility challenges.

Leveraging MATSimâ€™s powerful capabilities, I work on modeling intricate transportation scenarios and crafting **sustainable solutions** that make a difference.

ðŸš€ Let's connect and explore how we can **innovate and transform transportation** together.
