# About Me

Hi, I'm **Steffen Axer**, a senior transport modeller and an active developer of **MATSim** â€” a leading open-source framework for simulating transport systems.

My journey with MATSim spans from contributing to its **core development**, enhancing its **functionality**, to advocating for its **real-world application** in solving complex transportation challenges. Iâ€™m passionate about pushing the boundaries of how we understand and improve **mobility** in both urban and regional contexts.

Leveraging MATSimâ€™s powerful capabilities, I work on modeling intricate transportation scenarios and crafting **sustainable solutions** that make a difference.

ðŸš€ Let's connect and explore how we can **innovate and transform transportation** together.
